## Description ##

The User research team relies on Airshipâ€™s In-App messages structure to reach Onefootball users and ask them to take part to quantitative researches. 

## LIMITATION ##

Current setup do not permit the User research team to pass certain user information such as the DEVICE ID from SurveMoney through in-app message setup. 

## SOLUTION ##

Using Costum HTML option to pass variables and design the in-app message including: button message, visual, surveymonkey link to survey. 

## TASK ##

* define elements that form the in app message
* create HTML template that passes DEVICE ID 

Please keep in mind this is a *proof of concept* as this will be functional to enrich our data WH and future DMP. Therefore i set priority to minor as this should not be a blocker for your epics.
